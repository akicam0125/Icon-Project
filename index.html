<p class="intro">
  NEW YORK, NY -- New York City is home to approximately 65,000 bike delivery workers. As consumer demand for delivery apps like GrubHub, DoorDash and UberEats continue to soar throughout the pandemic, delivery workers are left strained and overworked. One recent <a href=https://twitter.com/UnequalScenes/status/1433252530713243648> viral video</a> of a bike delivery courier trudging through waist-deep water during Hurricane Ida sparked a debate on the harsh working conditions and unfair labor practices imposed onto these gig workers. From meager pay to health and safety issues, workers face a myriad of financial and physical challenges whilst delivering food efficiently for hungry New Yorkers.

  <div class="mainquestion">
  <h2>What are the challenges facing delivery workers?</h2></div>

    <h3>Low, unstable wages</h3>

      Bike couriers are classified as gig workers. They do not receive a stable salary. An average courier delivery person's income is $300 to $800 a week, which is often earned after working a full 12 hour work day, 7 days a week, according to the Gothamist. Some estimates show that the median pay for workers is less than $8 an hour.</p>

<h3>High up-front costs</h3>

  <p>
  Aside from the low pay, couriers must put down high up-front costs. The price tag for a new polished bike ranges anywhere from $800 to $1200. In addition, couriers usually equip their bikes with phone-charging mounts, lights, second batteries, air horns, racks, mud flaps, and bike chains, resulting in a total price tag of approximately $2500. Most delivery workers also purchase a spare $600 battery to swap out once their bikes eventually run out of energy during the day, and some even purchase garage space to store and charge their e-bikes, with parking spaces costing over $125 a month.</p>

  <h3>Safety Concerns</h3>

  <p>
    Bike couriers also face threats to health and safety.  Attempted robberies of delivery workers increased 65% in 2020 â€” around a third were violent, and some turned deadly. This March, Villalva Vitinio, a 29-year-old delivery rider for Uber Eats and Doordash, refused to give up his electric bike to an assailant. He was then shot and killed, according to police reports.
    There have also been recent accounts food-delivery workers being violently attacked on their way home from deliveries. Couriers were approached by gunmen and knife-weilding thieves, targeting couriers for their pricey e-bikes.
    Because gig workers are independent contractors, delivery apps such as UberEats, DoorDash, and GrubHub, are legally not obligated to provide workers with health insurance, workers' compensation, or sick leave.</p>

<p class="solutions">
  Thanks to ongoing pressure from labor advocacy groups like Los Deliveristas Unidos and supportive policymakers, the New York City Council passed a package of bills that would grant major benefits for bike couriers in September. Considered the first sweeping set of bills in the nation aimed to improve courier worker conditions, the legislative bills are considered a massive victory for workers' rights. The bills would:
  <div class="solutionbullets">
   <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Allow delivery workers to set a maximum distance per trip they travel</li>
  <li>Allow delivery workers to access bathrooms in the restaurants they retrieve orders from</li>
  <li>Prohibit delivery apps from soliciting additional tips unless they disclose how much is paid to the delivery worker, and whether or not it is available immediately or paid in cash</li>
  <li>Mandate food delivery apps to inform the delivery worker of the total wages earned, including tips, on a daily basis</li>
  <li>Clarify the gratuity policies for third party delivery apps</li>
   </ul>
